- HUD Fix
- Movement Control (hmd, game, controllers)
- Optimization

## Features & Fixes
- Added OpenXR integration directly into the Cyberpunk engine.
- Implemented **Fix Head** movement - decouples head from the player body for comfortable 3DoF/6DoF headset tracking without the body models aggressively pulling the camera.
- Overridden engine FOV properly via runtime hooks to calculate correct FOV for arbitrary VR aspect ratios.
- Decoupled `lod_fov_override` to fix shadow and object culling when turning the head in VR. The LOD system is tricked into thinking the FOV is narrow to prevent aggressive high-detail mesh culling under the feet.
- Fixed UI positioning and interaction logic.
- Hooked `CP2077SettingsRes` and `CP2077DLSSRes` to force resolutions properly suited for VR headsets, avoiding stretched or compressed views.
- Synchronized rendering pipeline (Engine settings, DLSS, DXGI Display Modes, and Swapchain) to support custom VR resolutions without breaking tracking, aspect ratio, or creating fish-eye effects.
- Added a pre-launch dynamic resolution selector dialog to cleanly set rendering sizes before the engine initializes.

## Installation
1. Download `dxgi.dll` from the Releases page.
2. Place `dxgi.dll` into the game directory where the `Cyberpunk2077.exe` is located (usually `Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/`).
3. Start the game.
