// DLSS5 NEURAL RENDER (src/Render/NeuralRender.cpp) -- experimental, off by default.
//
// NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural-render pass (NGX feature 18) run on each eye right after the game's own DLSS, its result
// written back over that eye's DLSS output. It needs nvngx_dlssnr.dll in the game's bin\x64 folder (it comes with
// the DLSS 5 add-ons, not with the game). The switch and every knob are the DLSS5-NR page of the F10 and VR menus
// (CyberpunkVR_Nr* exports); none of them is saved, so the next start is always without it.

namespace cvr::neural_render {

// Once per Present: the frame the alternate-eyes mode counts, and the NGX hook put in once the switch is on.
void OnPresent();

}  // namespace cvr::neural_render
