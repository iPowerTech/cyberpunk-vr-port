// THE EYE'S OWN FRUSTUM, RENDERED AS IT IS.
//
// A headset lens sits off the centre of its panel. A Quest 3 eye reports -54/+40 deg horizontally and
// +44/-55 vertically; rendering that symmetric about the eye axis means sizing to the widest half-angle
// (110 x 110 deg of tangent span for a 94 x 99 deg panel) and throwing a third of every rendered pixel
// away, with the centre that much softer. The engine can draw the off-centre frustum itself -- see
// src/Stereo/AsymProjection.cpp for where and how -- so each eye renders exactly its panel and the
// projection layer is submitted with exactly that frustum: nothing cropped, nothing black, nothing
// rendered for nobody.
//
// ONE FUNCTION DECIDES THE WINDOW, and the render side and the submit side both call it, so the
// rectangle the compositor is promised is the rectangle that was drawn.
//
//   * Horizontal: each eye's own runtime span, exactly.
//   * Vertical: one span for both eyes -- the engine gives a camera one vertical fov -- the larger of
//     the two, centred on each eye's own vertical centre. On a headset whose eyes agree vertically
//     (all of them in practice) that is each eye's own span, exactly.
//   * A canted headset (displays turned outward, eye poses rotated against the head) is rendered with
//     the HEAD's orientation for both eyes, so the eye's window is carried into the head frame by the
//     eye's yaw against the head first. Zero on a parallel headset.
//   * SQUARE PIXELS. The window is drawn into the render target edge to edge, so when the two aspects
//     differ the pixels are not square: resolution goes unevenly to the two axes. The shorter axis is
//     therefore grown until the window has the target's aspect -- never shrunk, so nothing the lens
//     shows is lost and nothing goes black; the extra sliver lies outside the lens and costs only its
//     few pixels. The launcher's ladders are shaped to the windows, which keeps that sliver near zero;
//     the fit is what keeps the pixels square whatever the runtime reports (a FOV cut in the runtime
//     changes the window, not the ladder).
