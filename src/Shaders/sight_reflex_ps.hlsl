// Replacement pixel shader for the holographic sight's reticle quad.
//
// Identified live as PS hash 66394C5F4B95AB9A (6271 bytes, DXIL / shader model 6.0), drawn as a
// 6-index instanced quad inside CRenderNode_RenderElements. Confirmed by removal: dropping this
// draw removes the reticle and nothing else.
//
// WHAT THE ORIGINAL DOES, and why it is wrong in VR
// -------------------------------------------------
// It samples the reticle atlas four times: once at the quad's own uv, and three more times
// displaced along the view direction in tangent space. Measured material constants:
//
//     _29_m0[7].x  = 0.1                     displacement scale
//     _29_m0[8]    = (1, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05)   weights of the four layers
//     _29_m0[12]   = (0.5, 0, 1, 0.5)        atlas rect of the reticle
//
// The crisp reticle is the FIRST layer -- the one with zero displacement. It is painted on the
// glass and does not move with the eye at all; the displaced layers are a faint shimmer. On a
// flat screen the eye is always on the sight's axis, so nothing gives it away. In VR you can
// look at the glass from the side and the dot follows you, which a collimated sight never does.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
// ----------------------
// A collimated sight projects its reticle to infinity along the bore. The eye therefore sees the
// dot at the one point on the glass where the line of sight is parallel to the bore, and sees
// nothing once that point leaves the window. That is an angular lookup, not a positional one:
//
//     uv = 0.5 + dist * float2(dot(V,T), dot(V,B)) / glassSizePerUv
//
// with V the direction from eye to pixel and dist their distance. The scale is DERIVED, not
// tuned: glassSizePerUv comes from the screen-space derivatives of the interpolated world
// position, so the reticle keeps exactly the apparent size the artist authored and there is no
// magic number to fit. The same construction is what the Crysis VR mod does with an explicit
// world-space aim point; here the aim point is at infinity, which is what a collimator gives.
//
// The dot vanishing off-axis needs no extra code: the sample coordinate is clamped into the
// atlas rect with a 1% inset (the original's own clamp, kept below), and the reticle's border is
// empty. That is the same mechanism the Crysis shader relies on.
//
// Signature reproduced from the original container's ISG1 chunk -- SV_Position0 plus TEXCOORD0..4
// at registers 0..5. The decompiler renamed those to TEXCOORD1..5 and dropped SV_Position; using
// its names would produce a signature the vertex shader does not match and the PSO would fail.

// ---- the two tunables, both physical ---------------------------------------------------------
// SIGHT_SIZE_SCALE corrects the glass size the vertex shader measures, if it turns out to be off
// by a constant. It is a CHECK, not a taste setting: the reticle's apparent size is a direct
// readout of it. At the correct value the collimated reticle is exactly as large as the stock
// one, because the mapping is then a pure translation; if it looks N times smaller, this is N.
#ifndef SIGHT_SIZE_SCALE

// SIGHT_RETICLE_DISTANCE is where the reticle is projected, in metres. A real collimator puts it
// at infinity, which is the default here. Finite values are not a fudge: the Crysis VR mod uses
// 10 m deliberately, because a reticle at infinity tracks head movement one-for-one and in VR the
// eye is not held steady by a cheek weld, so tracking noise shows up as a wandering dot.
// The blend is exact -- k = D/(d+D) with d the eye-to-glass distance -- so 0 reproduces the stock
// painted-on reticle and a large value reproduces full collimation.

// ZEROING. The collimation above is built around the glass NORMAL -- the dot sits where the line
// of sight through the glass is perpendicular to it. A bullet does not care about the glass: it
// leaves along the bore, and a reflex sight's window is deliberately tilted relative to that. So
// unless the model happens to mount the glass square to the bore, the dot is off by that tilt.
//
// The bore direction is known to the mod (the plugin publishes the muzzle forward in shared slots
// [24..26], which is what the barrel dot draws from) but NOT reachable from here: the root
// signature is the game's and there is no spare constant to carry it in.
//
// So the sight is zeroed the way a real one is -- by moving the reticle on the glass. Units are
// uv, i.e. 1.0 is the full width of the reticle across the window. The dot moves OPPOSITE to the
// sign, exactly like a windage screw.

// from the sight axis, so the gap between the two marks, measured in window widths, IS that
// offset divided by the glass width. One look per eye and the number stops being a deduction:
// if the eyes really are 65 mm apart on a 26 mm window, one of them must show the gap at 2.5
// widths -- and if instead both gaps are small, the glass is wider than the vertex buffer said
// and sizeU is the thing that is wrong.

// RETICLE ANGULAR SIZE. A collimator projects its reticle to infinity, so the reticle subtends
// the same angle wherever the eye is: moving the head closer to the window shows more window
// around it, never a bigger ring. Mapping the glass 1:1 onto the atlas (uv offset = world
// offset / glass size) fixes the reticle's size ON THE GLASS instead, so its angle grew as 1/d --
// at 5 cm a ring filled the window and was cut by its edges off-axis. The uv offset is therefore
// the line of sight's ANGLE off the bore (its tangent) times this distance: the reticle has its
// authored glass size, and today's look, for an eye this far from the glass, and the same angle
